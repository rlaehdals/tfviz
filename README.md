# üõ†Ô∏è Terraform Plan Visualizer - `tfviz`

Reading a large `terraform plan` output in JSON can be overwhelming, especially in complex infrastructures.  
**`tfviz`** is a simple CLI tool that takes `terraform show -json` output and generates a clean, visual HTML report.  
It summarizes key statistics and shows changes grouped by module and resource, making it easier to understand and share with your team.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### 1. Install Go

Make sure [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) is installed on your system.

### 2. Build the binary

```bash
go build -o tfviz main.go
```

### 3. (Optional) Move to global path
```bash
sudo mv tfviz /usr/local/bin/
```

### 4. Visualize your Terraform plan
In your Terraform project directory:

```bash
tfviz plan
```

This will start a temporary local web server and automatically open your default browser to show the visualized plan.
No HTML file is written to disk ‚Äî everything runs in memory.
Once you close the browser or exit the page, the server automatically shuts down.
